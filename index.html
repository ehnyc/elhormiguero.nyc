  <p>When ICE conducted an immigration probe at Tom Cat Bakery in 2017, the company gave workers only ten days notice to produce new documentation or be fired. The workers had spent 10 to 16 years building the city’s oldest artisanal bakery into an elite factory, now owned by the multinational baking corporation, Yamazaki. Tom Cat made a decision to hide the audit for months, denying undocumented workers the opportunity to deal with the audit in a timely manner and endangering the lives of their employees and their families.</p><br>

  <p>Workers came together under Brandworkers to fight this injustice, holding powerful actions that disrupted the distribution of Tom Cat’s products. Together, they were able to push their union to seek severance pay for the fired workers. Tom Cat’s offer was pitiful in return the chaos the audit had inflicted in these workers’ lives. Some workers took the offer under financial duress but many have continued to fight for justice, demanding that the company adopt simple, best practices to protect immigrant workers, including: audit notification, asking to see a warrant before allowing ICE into the factory, and dignified severance pay for displaced workers.</p><br>
  <p>Until Tom Cat officials agree to adopt the above conditions, workers are calling on restaurants, hotels, supermarkets, and consumers to stop buying and serving Tom Cat bread. Workers and allies have been able to exert pressure on restaurant leaders including Le Bernardin, The Spotted Pig, Tisserie, La Pulperia, and The Jean-Georges Restaurant Group, who have already ceased use of Tom Cat products in solidarity with the workers’ campaign. We now seek that same solidarity from Dr. Smood, a Danish billionaire’s pet project cafe in the United States.</p><br>

  <p>Earlier this year, workers visited Tom Cat’s new General Manager, Peter Sonenstein, in his home in Connecticut. He agreed to begin negotiating with the Tom Cat workers once again. Workers attended three rounds of negotiations over the summer where the bakery voiced interest in implementing policies on their relationship with ICE, but refused to budge on the severance offer they had made workers two years ago. An agreement to find a mediator to help navigate the conversation has since led to two months of stone-walling and silence from Tom Cat Bakery. Victory is within reach if we are able to have customers like Dr. Smood drop Tom Cat Bakery bread.</p><br>
