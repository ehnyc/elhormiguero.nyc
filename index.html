  <p>When ICE conducted an I-9 audit at Tom Cat Bakery in 2017, the company gave workers only ten days notice to produce new documentation or be fired. The workers had spent 10 to 16 years building the city’s oldest artisanal bakery into a very profitable business that supplies the city’s high-end restaurants and grocery stores. <strong>Tom Cat had known about the audit for months and made a decision to hide it from workers</strong>, denying them the opportunity to prepare for the audit in a timely manner, endangering their livelihoods, and the wellbeing of their families.</p><br>

  <p>At great personal risk, workers came together as Brandworkers members to fight this injustice. With the support of their community allies, workers led powerful actions that brought Tom Cat to the table. When the company abruptly cut off negotiations, the community rallied behind the workers. Since then, workers have moved dozens of high-profile restaurants to drop Tom Cat in support of their campaign. The workers have two demands: a fair severance that recognizes their years of service to the company, and the adoption of immigrant worker protection policies to prevent unnecessary trauma in the future.</p><br>

  <p>Until Tom Cat agrees to the above demands, workers will continue to call on restaurants, hotels, supermarkets and other businesses to stop serving Tom Cat bread products. NYC’s food manufacturing industry makes huge profits by exploiting immigrant workers. Despite an economy that marginalizes immigrant workers and a political administration that attacks immigrant communities, workers have demonstrated enormous power. Victory is within reach! Your solidarity can help Tom Cat workers win and inspire the immigrant worker justice movement across the country.</p><br>
